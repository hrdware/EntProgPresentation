### As a New Developer...
You will most likely be working with legacy code doing maintenance
- Unless the project is a rewrite, and then you will be expected to extrapolate from the existing code
---
Don't complain about the tools/technology you have to work with
- Without a good reason (the almighty dollar/profit)applications don't get rewritten
