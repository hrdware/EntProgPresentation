### Documentation
Be expected to read documentation and figure out how to make tools work for you
- No one will want to continually spoon feed you solutions, if they wanted to do that, they could have done it themselves
--- 
Be able to write good documentation/code comments
- You don't want to try and figure out a coplex piece of code, which you wrote, 6 weeks from now and have to spend hours tracing through it again.  If it is complex to begin with, it deserves comments
