### Pearl of Wisdom 3
Error Messages are a good thing - READ THEM
- They generally tell you what went wrong and where
- Search the web for more info, you probably aren't the first person to ever get that error message
- If you have to ask for help, the person you ask is going to want to know what the error message said
- Use all your tools (Stack Trace, code step through, variable inspections, console.log...)
