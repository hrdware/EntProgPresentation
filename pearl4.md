### Pearl of Wisdom 4
- Ask questions to get clarification and make sure you understand what the customer really wants
- Most non technical people don't think about all the small details you will need an answer to
- Try and get all the answers in one session, nobody wants to feel hassled or that you didn't think things through enough
